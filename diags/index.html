The Digital Product Model Master (DPMM) RDF vocabulary, described using W3C RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language.
An experimental ontology for defining entity relationships and data property definitions and constraints. Used as the digital framwork for a Digital Product Master(DPM)
<p>
</p>## Ontology What?</p>
<p>
Enterprise mythology chart, tables and diagrams have long been used to create paper visualizations of organizations activities, functions, process and data system.
</p>
<p>
A DPM is much more than that. It is a digital semantic model of those things and can lead to operationalizing what used to be only on paper.
A  semantic representation of information contains the meaning of the encapsulated relationships between between entities, actors, actions and data. 
In other words, the knowledge and information is contained in the data.
</p>
<p>
### So what is the Digital Product Model Master (DPMM) Ontology?
</p>
<p>
* This is the digital framework or scaffolding for constructing custom Digital Product Master.
* Provide predefined structures of DPM elements as a template for customization
* The semantic representation contains the meaning of entities and their encapsulated relationships . 
* In other words, the knowledge and information is contained in the data.

<p>
Ontologies and Semantic Vocabulary based datasets are represented as a Graph data model. The relationships between data entities, data properties and other entities are defined with semantic definitions  from common Linked Data references. This provide contextual meaning outside of an internal only dataset.
<p>
</p>
The graph model allows inference engines to deduce new facts from traversing and combining linked data.  They also can work backwards from goal assertions to find facts need to achieve that goal. 
</p>
<p>
An example is clustering and regression, two common Big Data analytical techniques.
</p>
<p>
By simply asserting data fields as ‘sameAs’ or ‘similarTo’ common standards, a powerful new set of question answering capabilities is unlessed. 
</p>
<p>
### DPM provides the pathway to answers to question not thought possible before.
